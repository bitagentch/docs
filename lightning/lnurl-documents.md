# [LNURL Documents](https://github.com/lnurl/luds)

LNURL documents (LUD's) describe a protocol for the use of lighning over http.  
Bitagent implements the following LUD's.

## [LUD-06: payRequest base spec.](https://github.com/lnurl/luds/blob/luds/06.md)
The basic data for a payment request.

## [LUD-12: Comments in payRequest.](https://github.com/lnurl/luds/blob/luds/12.md)
Adds a comment to the payment request.

## [LUD-16: Paying to static internet identifiers.](https://github.com/lnurl/luds/blob/luds/16.md)
This is the lighning address, which looks like an email address.  
Lightning addresses from Bitagent have the ending @bitagent.ch, support@bitagent.ch for example.
